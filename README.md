# Welcome to Defold

This project was created from the "basic 3D" project template.

The settings in ["game.project"](defold://open?path=/game.project) are mostly set to the default values. The render script is a modified version of the default render script with the addition that models are rendered in a separate pass after 2D components such as sprites and tilemaps. The physics type is set to 3D and not 2D.

The project contains a bootstrap ["main.collection"](defold://open?path=/main/main.collection) that includes a game object with a camera component and a game object with three different models.

Check out [the documentation pages](https://defold.com/learn) for examples, tutorials, manuals and API docs.

If you run into trouble, help is available in [our forum](https://forum.defold.com).

Happy Defolding!
